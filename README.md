## Installation

First - make sure you have [Julia installed](https://julialang.org/downloads/). 

### 1. Build libcxxwrap dependency

This is necessary to call the C++ code for the language model from Julia. (requires cmake)

    cd LanguageModel
    mdkir libcxxwrap-julia-build
    cd libcxxwrap-julia-build
    cmake ../libcxxwrap-julia
    make

### 2. [Download the language model (1.4 GB)](http://data.imagineville.org/lm/dec19_char/lm_dec19_char_huge_12gram.kenlm.gz)
 
Unzip the model and place it in the `LanguageModel` directory.
 
### 3. Build the C++ code

Now you need to build the C++ code (`languageModel.h/cpp`) for calling the language model. Execute the `compile_query_only.sh` script (`./compile_query_only.sh`). 

The `JULIA_INSTALL_DIR` variable in `compile_query_only.sh` should point to your Julia installation directory. By default it points to where Julia 1.7 is installed on macos.

### Julia packages

ColorCode requires the following Julia packages:
- DataStructures.jl
- CxxWrap.jl
- Interact.jl
- Blink.jl
- WAV.jl
- PortAudio.jl

## Use

### Launch

    julia main_gui.jl
*Warning:* It takes a few minutes for the GUI to startup.
  
### Controls

You can use a mouse to click the color buttons, or you can use the left arrow for red and the right arrow for blue.

### Exit

Exitting the GUI does not quit the program, so you need to kill the program (CTRL+C) in the command line after you exit out of the GUI.
